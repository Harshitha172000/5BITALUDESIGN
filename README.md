Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic  and logic operations. It is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit (cpu) of a computer. Most of the operations of the CPU are performed by either one or two ALUs. So ALU is a very important part of the CPU and it's very important to make sure that the calculations done by ALU are accurate. If we look at ALU from designers and fabrication point of view the main challenge is to minimize the space occupied by the hundreds of transistors and wind the entire sub-blocks of ALU into a single unit and thus make design compact.
